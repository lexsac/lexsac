# Hi there üëã 

I'm Lexsa, a recent full-stack software engineering grad with a passion for building beautiful, functional products. After seven years spent in performance marketing, I was ready for a new challenge and decided to pursue my years-long dream of learning how to code. My goal is to build cool things, work with great people, and learn as much as I possibly can along the way. 

##

<br>

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently **looking for entry-level software engineering roles, preferably front-end**.

- üå± Recently, I've been learning **React, Node.js, and Express**. I love working through [**Frontend Mentor**](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges since they help me learn so much and grow as an engineer. Take a look at my projects [**here**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/lexsac)!

- ü§ù I‚Äôm looking **new job opportunities that help me grow**.

- ‚ö° Fun fact: I usually have my greyhound, Mia, asleep at my feet most of the work day. She makes the occasional appearance on work calls if bribed with treats. 

- üì´ Please feel free to reach out! **lexsacampbell@gmail.com**
