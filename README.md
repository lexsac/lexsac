# Hi there 👋 

I'm Lexsa, a full stack software engineer with a passion for building beautiful, functional digital products. As a former performance marketer, I spent years working alongside engineers to optimize our digital products for customer growth. I finally decided to pursue my years-long dream of learning how to code myself, and I am so glad I did.

My goal is to build cool things, work with great people, and learn as much as I possibly can along the way.

<br>

- 🔭 I’m currently **looking for entry-level software engineering roles**.

- 🌱 Recently, I've been working with **React**, and I am really excited to dive into Material UI next.

- 🤝 I’m looking for **new job opportunities that help me grow as an engineer**.

- 🏄‍ Before engineering, I spent six years in customer acquisition growth for brands like Dropbox, Society6, Saatchi Art, and Verizon.
